## Section 102 (00:07:10)

**Transcript:**
> And by putting our agents on premises, we can say some money by buying hardware upfront or repurposing hardware that we already own rather than paying ongoing fees for high spec cloud servers.



**Visual Reference:**

## Section 106 (00:07:43)

**Transcript:**
> And then our agents will be on premises. This will help save us a little bit of money. And I'm also going to throw in a perforced proxy and under a game sync, but I'll talk a bit more about why they're here.



**Visual Reference:**

## Section 111 (00:08:30)

**Transcript:**
> Just as a reminder, these are the four things we need to deploy for our hot server. That'll be the hot server itself, MongoDB and red as databases and something to serve the dashboard.



**Visual Reference:**

## Section 112 (00:08:44)

**Transcript:**
> As a starting point, we can reference FX or deployment again and we can consider these managed databases offered by AWS, which are document, TV and elastication.



**Visual Reference:**

![Screenshot 112](screenshots/112_plus0.0s.png)

_Screenshot from 00:08:44_



---



## Section 113 (00:08:56)

**Transcript:**
> So these managed databases are kind of intended to be drop in replacements for Mongo and red as they come with extra features, other box, like high availability and automatic backups.



**Visual Reference:**

![Screenshot 113](screenshots/113_plus0.0s.png)

_Screenshot from 00:08:56_

**Visual Reference:**

![Screenshot 114](screenshots/114_plus0.0s.png)

_Screenshot from 00:09:07_



---



## Section 115 (00:09:18)

**Transcript:**
> So instead of using document DB and the last case, we could also deploy Mongo and red as directly to self managed EC2 instances.



**Visual Reference:**

![Screenshot 115](screenshots/115_plus0.0s.png)

_Screenshot from 00:09:18_

_Screenshot from 00:09:33_



---



## Section 118 (00:09:41)

**Transcript:**
> But we can take this a bit further actually. Here we have our cheapest option. We can provision a single EC2 instance and then run all the services we need using Docker.



**Visual Reference:**

![Screenshot 118](screenshots/118_plus0.0s.png)

_Screenshot from 00:09:41_



---



## Section 119 (00:09:52)

**Transcript:**
> While this option is cheap, we're only paying for one server now. It's going to offer the least flexibility. If you want to scale this in the future, you're going to have to migrate everything to new servers.



**Visual Reference:**

![Screenshot 119](screenshots/119_plus0.0s.png)

_Screenshot from 00:09:52_

## Section 122 (00:10:17)

**Transcript:**
> Although we lose out on the ability to scale horizontally, it's not something that we necessarily need to meet the needs of a small team.



**Visual Reference:**

_Screenshot from 00:10:17_



---



## Section 123 (00:10:27)

**Transcript:**
> So we're also going to need something to serve the dashboard. It's just a static site. So that gives us quite a few options. We could use almost any of the shelf server and AWS also offers solutions for this.



**Visual Reference:**

![Screenshot 123](screenshots/123_plus0.0s.png)

_Screenshot from 00:10:27_



---



## Section 124 (00:10:41)

**Transcript:**
> But we can also just use the whole server and while we could offload this work to something else, it's going to make very little impact and also increase the complexity of that appointment.



**Visual Reference:**

![Screenshot 124](screenshots/124_plus0.0s.png)

_Screenshot from 00:10:41_

## Section 125 (00:10:52)

**Transcript:**
> The only real benefit to hosting it separately would be that we can deploy new updates for dashboard without having to deploy a whole new image to our old server.



**Visual Reference:**

![Screenshot 125](screenshots/125_plus0.0s.png)

_Screenshot from 00:10:52_



---



## Section 126 (00:11:02)

**Transcript:**
> So now we have a hot server running as well as the required databases and the dashboard. We've chosen a local solution by opting for a single EC2 instance while still understanding the drawbacks of this choice, like the lack of scalability and the flexibility to add them to the future.



**Visual Reference:**

![Screenshot 126](screenshots/126_plus0.0s.png)

_Screenshot from 00:11:02_

## Section 127 (00:11:19)

**Transcript:**
> So now we have a hot server. We need to choose a storage backend for it.



**Visual Reference:**

_Screenshot from 00:11:19_



---



## Section 128 (00:11:25)

**Transcript:**
> A hot is going to generate a few different files that we will need to store. This can be things like build artifacts, like your package builds or logs from the jobs are running.



**Visual Reference:**

![Screenshot 128](screenshots/128_plus0.0s.png)

_Screenshot from 00:11:25_

## Section 129 (00:11:36)

**Transcript:**
> And all supports multiple storage backends for this. It can be an external cloud-based solution like Amazon's S3 or azure's blob store.



**Visual Reference:**

## Section 130 (00:11:44)

**Transcript:**
> But we also have the option for using the local storage of our EC2 instance, which in this case will be an EBS volume we've allocated to it.



**Visual Reference:**

![Screenshot 130](screenshots/130_plus0.0s.png)

_Screenshot from 00:11:44_



---



## Section 131 (00:11:53)

**Transcript:**
> So should we use that EBS volume? With EBS, we kind of have to allocate a certain amount of storage. If we run out, we have to allocate more or remove data.



**Visual Reference:**

## Section 132 (00:12:03)

**Transcript:**
> It can offer better IRE performance compared to S3, but that's kind of assuming there's no other bottlenecks.



**Visual Reference:**

_Screenshot from 00:12:10_



---



## Section 134 (00:12:16)

**Transcript:**
> So what about S3 then? A nice benefit is that it doesn't really have a storage limit. You just pay for what you use.



**Visual Reference:**

![Screenshot 134](screenshots/134_plus0.0s.png)

_Screenshot from 00:12:16_



---



## Section 135 (00:12:24)

**Transcript:**
> But a major benefit here is actually that now hold can use pre-sign URLs, which essentially means clients can upload and download data directly to and from S3, kind of bypassing our hot server.



**Visual Reference:**

![Screenshot 135](screenshots/135_plus0.0s.png)

_Screenshot from 00:12:24_

_Screenshot from 00:12:36_



---



## Section 137 (00:12:41)

**Transcript:**
> So here we're going to choose S3. It's nice that it is cheaper and doesn't have a storage limit. But yeah, the pre-sign URLs is really a major benefit here.



**Visual Reference:**

![Screenshot 137](screenshots/137_plus0.0s.png)

_Screenshot from 00:12:41_



---



## Section 138 (00:12:55)

**Transcript:**
> So now we've chosen S3 as our storage backend. It's offered lower prices and increased convenience, as well as the ability to now use pre-sign URLs.



**Visual Reference:**

_Screenshot from 00:14:13_



---



## Section 149 (00:14:19)

**Transcript:**
> What this means is the agent doesn't have enough available RAM to saturate all of the cores. So it's not really going to be enough to just throw more cores at your agent.



**Visual Reference:**

## Section 174 (00:17:24)

**Transcript:**
> To achieve this, we could just push our project into the same stream as our engine. And that's definitely a valid way of doing it. But I'd like to show you an alternative.

## Section 175 (00:17:35)

**Transcript:**
> And that's using stream components. What this allows us to do is essentially create a separate stream for our project. And then we can map the contents of that stream to any workspace created for our engine.



**Visual Reference:**

## Section 177 (00:17:54)

**Transcript:**
> So why would you even bother doing it this way using stream components kind of decouples your engine and project streams, meaning they can be mixed and matched or merged and branched in isolation.



**Visual Reference:**

## Section 181 (00:18:40)

**Transcript:**
> Meaning if the proxy already has a file, the client is requesting we don't need to redone download that file from the server. And this can lead to improvements in sync times as well as reducing the load on our purple server.



**Visual Reference:**

_Screenshot from 00:18:54_



---



## Section 183 (00:19:06)

**Transcript:**
> So to achieve this, we'll need a host name that resolves to different IPs on each machine. So on our agents this this host name will result to the IP of our purple proxy and then on our board server this host name will result to the IP of our purple server.



**Visual Reference:**

![Screenshot 183](screenshots/183_plus0.0s.png)
