00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:06,299
So, hello, everyone.

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:07,639
Thanks for coming to my talk.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,820
Today, I'm going to be talking about Horde, specifically how it can be used by small teams,

4
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,800
and I'll show you ways we've reduced cost, and I'll show you what's actually involved

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,980
in deploying Horde.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,440
So, before I get into things, just a little bit about me and the company I work for.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,800
So, my name's Ash.

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,719
I'm a lead real-time developer at S1T2.

9
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:36,579
While my main focus is leading development on our Unreal-based experiences, I'm also responsible

10
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:40,299
for maintaining and developing the DevOps pipelines for these projects.

11
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,899
So, at S1T2, we mostly create immersive and interactive experiences, typically for institutions

12
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,780
like our galleries and museums.

13
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:56,859
And we use a lot of different technologies, but we mainly use Unreal Engine for these experiences.

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,740
So, at S1T2, we're a team that cares about fast iteration.

15
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:11,099
It's kind of due to the experimental nature of our work, as well as short timelines, and the need to adapt to changing requirements.

16
00:01:12,459 --> 00:01:19,120
Our core team is also small, but we may expand our team with contractors or other partners depending on the work we take on.

17
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,700
And our team is also hybrid.

18
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,939
Some people work from the office or work from home, or maybe on-site in another country.

19
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,799
So, having remote access to our tools and infrastructure is important.

20
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:36,560
Actually, the picture in the bottom right is from the time we did a job in Dubai, and I got stuck there for like five months.

21
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:46,019
So, this talk is targeted towards small teams who are interested in Horde, but are unsure if it's the right thing for them.

22
00:01:46,699 --> 00:01:49,840
As well as teams that don't have continuous integration set up yet.

23
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:56,780
To get the most out of this talk, it would be best to have some knowledge of Horde or similar tools, but it's okay if you don't.

24
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,620
Actually, how many people went to Jack's talk earlier on Horde?
