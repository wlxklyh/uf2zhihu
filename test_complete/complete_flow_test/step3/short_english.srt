1
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:06,299
So, hello, everyone.

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:07,639
Thanks for coming to my talk.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,820
Today, I'm going to be talking about Horde, specifically how it can be used by small teams,

4
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,800
and I'll show you ways we've reduced cost, and I'll show you what's actually involved

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,980
in deploying Horde.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,440
So, before I get into things, just a little bit about me and the company I work for.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,800
So, my name's Ash.

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,719
I'm a lead real-time developer at S1T2.

9
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:36,579
While my main focus is leading development on our Unreal-based experiences, I'm also responsible

10
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:40,299
for maintaining and developing the DevOps pipelines for these projects.
